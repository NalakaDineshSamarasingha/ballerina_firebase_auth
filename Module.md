# Module Overview

This module provides functionality for generating Firebase authentication tokens using a service account JSON file. It is designed to streamline secure integration with Firebase services by leveraging JWT-based authentication and OAuth2 token generation.

### Key Features:
- Reads and processes Firebase service account credentials from a JSON file.
- Generates signed JWT tokens for Firebase authentication.
- Retrieves OAuth2 access tokens using the generated JWT.
- Handles token expiration and automatically regenerates tokens.

This module simplifies the process of authenticating and interacting with Firebase APIs in Ballerina programs.
